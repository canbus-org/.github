# @canbus

The CANbus Organization (or `@canbus`) is dedicated to providing a cohesive collection of
documentation, resources, and utilities related to the Controller Area Network protocol.

> This organization and its repositories are still under their initial construction stage.  
> Please excuse the dust while we get things in order. Thank you!

## Documentation

Our documentation for DBC files and CAN protocol is located at [@nberlette/canbus], with a DBC reference located in the [repository wiki](https://github.com/nberlette/canbus/wiki). It will eventually be relocated to this organization.

like JSR and NPM. It offers worldwide distribution and therefore availability through a
vast array of different package managers and CDN services.
